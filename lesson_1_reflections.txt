How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file
help you see the bug that was introduced?
---
This is interesting in a way.
I feel the power of the command line!
Muhahaha!
Anyway, yes I can clearly see the many advantages
of VC tools as opposed to doing everything by eye.
It's easy to see when using diff or FC.


PROMPT: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I would save time by not
getting lost among my versions
and I am not very organized anyway, 
so I will take all the help I can get, lol.

I am just a beginner but I definitely see the value in all this. 


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does? 

The pro is that my commits are meaningful. The con is that I'm human and perhaps I'll forget and do lots of work without committing. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because some projects deal with multiple inter-related files and some don't. That's really all there is to say about that. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Well, log shows you all the commits, and diff shows you the changes. It's pretty simple, really. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Oh, let me just say, I'm still not all that confident. But I'll get there, lady.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Oh, I don't know. About $3.50.
